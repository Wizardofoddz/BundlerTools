# BundlerTools
A collection of shellscripts for installing and running Bundler and PMVS on Debian and Fedora like Unix systems

- sudo apt-get install git
if you don't already have git installed.
2. When finished, navigate to a directory where you would like the BundlerTools application to be
installed (using the cd command, e.g. cd Desktop) and type
- git clone https://github.com/qwesda/BundlerTools.git

This will create a "BundlerTools" folder and download the scripts to it. Navigate into this folder (again,
using the cd comand; e.g. "~/Desktop/BundlerTools. ~ is the abbrevation for the home-directory) and
run the install-script by typing
- cd BundlerTools
- sudo bash install-centos.sh
